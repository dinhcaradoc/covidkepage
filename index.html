            <p id="about"> Covid-19 is a respiratory illness affecting the lungs. It is caused by a new virus, the novel corona virus. The disease is easily spread through contact with droplets from an infected person when this person coughs or sneezes, or sometimes just when they talk. Transmission can also occur through contact with surfaces and objects that have been contaminated. No treatment or vaccine is available for the disease, since it is viral-based. <span id="more"><a href="http://www.health.go.ke/" target="_blank">LEARN MORE</a></span></p>
